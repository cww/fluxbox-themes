# Fluxbox Themes

Themes I've written and/or adapted for Fluxbox, a lightweight Linux window
manager.

There's only one so far. :)

## Squared_red

I enjoyed Squared_blue quite a bit, but it didn't fit well when I switched to
a red desktop background image.  I changed Squared_blue's color definitions to
use a red hue and adjusted the images accordingly with ImageMagick's `convert`
utility.

The original Squared_blue is attributed to `endel (endel@tlen.pl)` and carries
a CC-By-SA 3.0 license, which Squared_red preserves.
